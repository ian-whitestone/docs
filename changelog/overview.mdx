  # Understand and optimize total asset cost with SELECT’s data lineage

  To help users understand their total data asset cost and better understand dependencies, we’ve extended our [data lineage feature](https://select.dev/docs/lineage) to add first class support for [Snowpipe](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-snowpipe) and Dynamic Tables.

  ![SELECT lineage feature to add first class support for Snowpipes and Dynamic Tables.](https://select.dev/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/1zmOcgV1p520E4lLTrYjjg/d71dbfb8-8424-405f-9bcc-f16b16a87900/width=3840,quality=75)

  This feature is available to all Snowflake customers on an Enterpise Edition or higher, and can be accessed through the Lineage tab on each Dynamic Table or Snowpipe workload page.

  * 🪄 Configuring Monitors is now easier with new templates added covering common use cases
