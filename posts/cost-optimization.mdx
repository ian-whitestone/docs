# What is Qualify in Snowflake?

The qualify clause in Snowflake, or generally in SQL, enables filtering based on the result of a window function.  A window function cannot be used in the `where` clause directly, so use `qualify` instead when you need to filter on window functions.

## A Fast Refresher on Window Functions

A window function is a function that operates on a set of rows in relation to the current row.  They are often used to calculate ranks, running totals, moving averages, count by partitions, etc.  Whenever you need to reference the rows above or below the current row, you need a window function.  And the qualify clause is just a shortcut to filtering on a window function.

## Qualify Syntax

Syntax is as follows:

```sql
SELECT <column_list>
FROM <data_source>
where <conditions>
[GROUP BY ...]
[HAVING ...]
QUALIFY  <predicate>
ORDER BY
```

You can see that `qualify` comes at the end of the SQL query, right before the optional `order by` clause.
