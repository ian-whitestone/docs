## Why SELECT?

Snowflake is an incredibly powerful platform, easily scaling to handle ever-larger data volumes without compromising on performance. But, if not controlled, costs associated with this scaling quickly climb. Whether your goal is to reduce the price of an upcoming renewal, extend your existing contract's runway, or reduce on-demand costs, SELECT can help.

SELECT is a SaaS web application that helps Snowflake users maximize ROI by providing visibility into spend, optimizing performance and automatically lowering costs. You can explore all of our features here, or learn more about our company and frequently asked questions here.

## Get Started

[Sign up](https://select.dev/signup?source=%2Fdocs&source_location=get_started) for immediate access and 30-day free trial, or [book a demo](https://select.dev/demo) if you'd like to see the product in action first.

Once ready, you can get up and running in 15 minutes by following these two steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new Snowflake user">
    SELECT requires a Snowflake user with limited, read-only access to your Snowflake metadata. See our step-by-step instructions [here](https://select.dev).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your account">
    Once the user is created, [connect your Snowflake account](https://select.dev) in the SELECT web application UI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it!
